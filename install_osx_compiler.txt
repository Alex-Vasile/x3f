Cross compilation for OS X
It is not yet ready for automatic install.
This is just some notes on how to do it.
NOTE: this take a long time

The following packages needs to be installed
--------------------------------------------
sudo apt-get install clang
sudo apt-get install llvm-dev
sudo apt-get install patch
sudo apt-get install uuid-dev
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install lipmpc-dev
sudo apt-get install libmpfr-dev
sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev

Then you need the OS X 10.7 SDK
https://github.com/JuliaEichler/Mac_OSX_SDKs
Do nothing here. It is downloaded below.

To build you need to make the following in a directory of your choice
---------------------------------------------------------------------
git clone https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross.git
cd osxcross
cd tarballs
wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/4wjaet5xmjriago/MacOSX10.7.sdk.tar.xz
cd ..
JOBS=`nproc` ./build.sh
JOBS=`nproc` ./build_gcc.sh

Then you need to add the following to your .bashrc
--------------------------------------------------
`<path>/osxcross/target/bin/osxcross-env`

The backquotes are there because the call returns commands.
Dangerous!! But, that is how it is.
