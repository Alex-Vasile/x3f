x3f_033 Roland 2010-08-07
  First git based version

x3f_032 Roland 2010-08-07
  Changed interface of x3f_extract
  Removed extraction of RAW from x3f_io_test
  Fixed gamma_scale in x3f_io
  Updated readme file
  Now the project is ready for gitify!

x3f_031 Roland 2010-07-31
  Restructuring. Preparing for git!

x3f_030 Roland 2010-07-29
  Now both CAMF and image decoding are correct for TRUE engine stuff!!

x3f_029 Roland 2010-07-29
  CAMF type 4 is working
  Need to fix the image decompression so it also gets correct

x3f_028 Roland 2010-07-27
  CAMF type 4 is nearly working - most data is correct.
  The TRUE RAW decoding is affected by the CAMF decoding and not fixed.

x3f_027 Roland 2010-07-21
  Fixed so the TRUE engine RAW decoding is Bayer CFA style,
  i.e. odd and even pixels are decoded separately on each line.

x3f_026 Roland 2010-07-21
  Some more steps towards reading CAMF type 4

x3f_025 Roland 2010-07-19
  CAMF type 2 (SD9-SD14) is working
  CAMF type 4 (DP1-...) is not implemented

x3f_024 Roland 2010-07-18
  Added SECp / properties

x3f_023 Roland 2010-07-17
  Refacturing old RAW engine to reuse the new TRUE engine
  bit reading machinery.

x3f_022 Roland 2010-07-16
  Now the code can unpack TRUE engine coded images!!

x3f_021 Roland 2010-07-16
  Some cleaning up
  And yet another step towards the TRUE engine

x3f_020 Roland 2010-07-16
  A correct huffman tree is now built for TRUE engine

x3f_019 Roland 2010-07-15
  Made creation of huffman table more generic

x3f_018 Roland 2010-07-15
  Reading and writing TRUE engine data
  No parsing yet 

x3f_017 Roland 2010-06-27
  Hmmmm ... some CAMF data structures added a long time ago ...
  ... Dont know what that is.
  Some (old) changes of names.
  Cleaning up after some years of root
  Removing data_type.
  Tested that all still work.

x3f_016 Roland 2008-07-21
  Preparing for release
  Adding BSD-license

x3f_015 Roland 2008-07-20

x3f_014 Roland 2008-07-19
  Porting to Mac
  Porting to Windows

x3f_013 Roland 2008-07-13
  Loading the entire image block added

x3f_012 Roland 2008-07-12
  Added makefile
  Added list of files to convert
  Added gamma support

x3f_011 Roland 2008-07-12
  Added tiff support

x3f_010 Roland

x3f_009 Roland 2007-10-16
  Fixing more bugs
  AND NOW IT WORKS! !!!! !!!!  !!!!!!

x3f_008 Roland 2007-10-15
  Fixing some bugs
  Dumping PPM
  STILL - IT DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!!!

x3f_007 Roland 2007-10-14
  First try at doing the Huffman decoding
  IT DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!!!

x3f_006 Roland 2007-10-13
  Fixed some bugs and cleaned up

x3f_005 Roland 2007-09-15
  Now creates correct huffman decoding tree for RAW

x3f_004 Roland 2007-09-08
  Loading of some more types
  Cleanups

x3f_003 Roland 2007-09-08
  Cleanups

x3f_002 Roland 2007-09-08
  Can read file
  Can load Huffman - without decoding
  Can write file - with or without loaded Huffman

x3f_001 Roland 2007-08-29
  Added
